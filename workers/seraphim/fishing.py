"""Calm mode, solunar windows and bite scoring.

Strategically this is not a side feature. A flood app opened twice in a lifetime is an
app nobody has installed when it matters. The tide and weather data already fetched for
flood work answers a question people have on the other 350 days, so the same install is
already present, already trusted and already granted location permission on the day the
river comes up. **Retention is a safety feature.**

The scoring is deliberately transparent and rule-based. Fishing advice is folklore-rich
and evidence-poor, so rather than implying more certainty than exists, every score shows
the factors that produced it and the user can disagree with any of them.

What the rules encode:
  * fish feed on MOVING water, so the rate of tidal change matters far more than the
    height, peak flow near mid-tide beats slack water at the top
  * low light concentrates feeding: dawn and dusk outrank midday
  * solunar theory (Knight, 1926) puts major periods at lunar transit and antitransit,
    minor periods at moonrise and moonset
  * falling barometric pressure ahead of a front is the one weather signal with broad
    angler consensus
